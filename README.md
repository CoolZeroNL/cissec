Attempt to provide a kickstart file for CentOS 7 which provides a starting point for a linux admin to build a host which meets the CIS CentOS 7 benchmarks

Aforementioned CIS benchmarks should be able to be found here https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/linux/CIS_CentOS_Linux_7_Benchmark_v1.1.0.pdf

A minimal kickstart file is provided so people can test their setup (PXE/DHCP etc) with the minimal amount of configuration going on.
